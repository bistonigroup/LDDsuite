The **LDD suite**  computes atomic contributions to the London dispersion energy and the dispersion density. It is based on the [**Atomic Decomposition of London Dispersion energy (ADLD)**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00356) method and includes the following tools:

- `lddensity.py` – computes atomic dispersion contributions using the selected Grimme's dispersion correction and generates a `.cube` file with the London dispersion density function.
- `PubQualityVMD.tcl` – VMD script to automatically set visualization parameters for publication-quality images.

# Tools Description

## lddensity.py
Python script to compute atomic contributions to the London dispersion energy and the London dispersion density function using D3 or D4 corrections.

- **Input**: 
  - `{basename}.xyz` : a classic `.xyz` file containing atomic coordinates of the system in ångström. 
- **Output**:
  - `.d3atomwise.txt` or `.d4atomwise.txt` : a file containing atomic coordinates of the system with an additional column indicating each atom contribution to the London dispersion energy.
  - `.d3out.txt` or `.d4out.txt` : the original output generated by Grimme's DFT-D3 or DFT-D4 executable, respectively.
  - `.d3omega.cube` or `.d4omega.cube` : a `.cube` file that stores volumetric data of the LDD function, which can be used to easily visualize atomic contributions to London dispersion.

> [!NOTE]
> If atomic contributions are computed or if you want to plot the dispersion difference density between two molecular systems,  
> you can use the script solely to generate the `.cube` file.  
> In the latter case, first compute the atomic contributions for both systems, then build a new `{basename}.atomwise.txt` file  
> containing the difference of the atomic contributions between the two structures.  
> See [Generate Only the Cube File](#generate-only-the-cube-file) for more information.

## PubQualityVMD.tcl
Script designed to visualize LD density function from a `.cube` file, adjusting VMD settings to generate publication-quality images.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x with standard libraries.
- For `lddensity.py`, ensure that `.xyz` file and the respective DFT-D3 or DFT-D4 executable are in the current path. The executable can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/grimme/de/software).
- For London dispersion density difference ensure `{basename}.atomwise.txt` is in the current path. See [Dispersion Density Difference](#dispersion-density-difference) section for more information.
- To use `PubQualityVMD.tcl` you must have VMD installed on your computer. VMD can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).
- VMD installed for running PubQualityVMD.tcl ([download](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)).

# Usage

## lddensity.py

1. Ensure `{basename}.xyz` file is at the current path.
2. Run the script:

    <pre><code style="font-size: 13px;">python3 lddensity.py &lt;basename&gt; [-h] [--d {3,4}] [--npoints NPOINTS] [--func FUNC] [--damp DAMP] [--nprocs NPROCS] [--charge CHARGE]
                    [--s9 S9] [--onlycube]</code></pre>

## PubQualityVMD.tcl
1. Ensure the input `.cube` file you want to visualize is correctly named and located within an accessible directory (it's recommended to work within a single directory).
2. Edit the script with your favorite text editor to include the path name in `set file_name` command.
3. Run the script with the following command:

    <pre><code style="font-size: 13px;">vmd -e PubQualityVMD.tcl</code></pre>

> [!NOTE] 
> When a `.cube` file is loaded, if the `{basename}.atomwise.txt` file is present in the same folder, you can use the _pick_ feature in VMD (_Mouse_ > _Pick_) to visualize the dispersion energy of individual atoms upon selection.
> Some functions within the script are commented out by default for safety. However, if you are interested in exploring or utilizing these functions, you can easily uncomment them. \
> Auto color scaling is enabled by default. \
> Auto rendering is disabled by default. Set `render_mode` to `1` to enable it ([ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) is required).

> [!TIP]
> Change the rotation angles (`rot_x`, `rot_y`, `rot_z`) and the moleculare size (`scale_val`) to display the molecule according to your preference.
> For better visualization, set `autoscale` to `1` and choose symmetric values for `colorscale_min` and `colorscale_max`.
 
# Arguments Description

Below is a detailed table of the arguments that can be used with our script. Each entry provides you with the name of the argument, a brief description, information on whether the argument is optional, and the default value it takes if not specified by the user. This table is designed to help you quickly understand how to configure the script to meet your specific requirements.

| Argument  | Description | Optional | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **basename** | The base name for the input `.xyz` file. | No | *None* |
| **d** | Specifies the D correction (D3 or D4) | Yes | 4 |
| **npoints** | Specifies the number of grid points for each dimension in the density calculation. | Yes | 80 |
| **func**   | Defines the functional to be used in the calculation. Refer to [DFT-D3](https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/grimme/de/software/dft-d3/man.pdf)/[DFT-D4](https://github.com/dftd4/dftd4/tree/main) manual for all available functionals. | Yes | `b3-lyp` |
| **damp**    | Specifies the damping function to be used in the D3 calculation, refer to [DT-D3 manual](https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/grimme/de/software/dft-d3/man.pdf) for all available damping functions. | Yes | `bj` |
| **charge**  | Sets the overall charge of the molecule being analyzed in the D4 calculation. | Yes | 0 |
| **s9**     | A coefficient that scale the ATM (Axilrod-Teller-Muto) term for three-body dispersion in the D4 calculation. Allows users to adjust the contribution of three-body interactions in the dispersion energy. Set to 0 to eliminate this contribution or 1 to include three-body in D3 | Yes | 0 |
| **nprocs**  | Determines the number of processors used for parallel computation. | Yes | 1 |
| **onlycube**  | Generates only the `.cube` file. See [Generate Only the Cube File](#generate-only-the-cube-file) section | Yes | False |

# Generate Only the Cube File
If you have already computed the atomic contributions (for example using another software), or if you want to plot the **dispersion density difference function**, you can use the `--onlycube` flag in `lddensity.py`.  

In this case, the input file is **not** a standard `.xyz`, but rather an `.xyz` file with an extra column containing the atomic dispersion contributions in kcal/mol.  
The file must be named `{basename}.atomwise.txt`, which corresponds to the file produced by the script when the `--onlycube` flag is **not** used.

An example of `.atomwise.txt` file for the $C_6H_6–Li$ system is:

```
#
atom   x(Å)         y(Å)        z(Å)        Edisp(kcal/mol)
C      -2.378672     1.005050   -0.079453   -2.128400

## Dispersion Density Difference
To generate the **dispersion density difference** between two molecular systems:  

1. Compute the atomic dispersion contributions for both systems separately.  
2. Be sure there's an atom-to-atom mapping between the two structures. 
3. Build a new `{basename}.atomwise.txt` file where the atomic dispersion contribution for each atom corresponds to the **difference** between its values in the two systems.
4. Use this difference file as input to generate the `.cube` file with `--onlycube`.  

This procedure allows you to visualize the difference between atomic LD contributions for two different molecular structures (e.g., a pair of structures along a reaction profile).

An example command could be:

```bash
python3 lddensity.py system_diff --onlycube --npoints 80 --nprocs 2
```
